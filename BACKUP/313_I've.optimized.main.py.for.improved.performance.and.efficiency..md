# [I've optimized main.py for improved performance and efficiency.](https://github.com/yihong0618/gitblog/pull/313)

This commit introduces several optimizations to main.py:

- GitHub API Usage:
  - I've made it so issues and labels are now fetched once at the beginning of the script's execution and cached.
  - I've refactored functions for generating README sections, RSS feed, and identifying issues for backup to use this cached data, significantly reducing redundant API calls.

- Issue Backup:
  - I've streamlined the process for backing up issues (when --issue_number is provided) to prioritize the specified issue, while still allowing for a general scan of other issues needing backup.

- README Generation:
  - I've changed it so content for different README sections is now generated in memory and written to the README.md file in a single operation, instead of multiple append operations.

- Dependencies:
  - I've updated dependencies in requirements.txt (PyGithub, feedgen, marko, markdown) to their latest stable versions.

These changes aim to make the script run faster, consume fewer API resources, and improve code maintainability.
